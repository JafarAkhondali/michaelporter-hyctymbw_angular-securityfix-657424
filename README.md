Basic learning app for Angular.js, using data from a simple application I made
a few months ago:

  http://www.haveyouconsideredthatyoumightbewrong.com

The server is a super naive Node.js implementation, but it serves for the
purpose of getting to know Angular without loading other libraries.

This project can be found at angular-wrong.herokuapp.com, in all it's currently-unstyled
glory.
